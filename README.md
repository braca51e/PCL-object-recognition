# PCL-object-recognition

This is a [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/) based object recognition project highly based on PCL's cluster recognition and 6DOF pose estimation using VFH (viewpoint feature histogram) descriptors [tutorial](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/vfh_recognition.php#vfh-recognition).

It was done as a final project for the computer vision course offered in Ko√ß University. The project report (for detailed inspection) is also available in the *details.pdf* file.
